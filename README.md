# Solar_Pomodro_tracker
Welcome to our repository, made by Me(RMS) for Solar
This Project is started because we want a better way of working and therefore we need a gadget
to show when we are busy at working trying to dig in to a task

we then heard about Pomodro, and thought it was a greate Idea.
so we bought some Luxafor lights, but the software did not work as we want it.
